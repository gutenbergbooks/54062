<h3>LITERARY SUPERIORITY</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE excellent judgment displayed in the publications of the house at the
very beginning of its career, and the success of the modern business
methods employed by it, at once attracted the attention of leading men
in the profession, and many of the most prominent writers of America
offered their books for publication. Thus, there were produced in rapid
succession a number of works that immediately placed the house in the
front rank of Medical Publishers. One need only cite such instances as
Keen’s five-volume work on Surgery, Kelly and Noble’s Gynecology and
Abdominal Surgery, Fowler’s Surgery, Ashton’s Gynecology, Moynihan’s
works on Abdominal Operations and on Gallstones, Sahli, Kinnicutt, and
Potter’s Diagnostic Methods, Stengel’s Pathology, Hirst’s Obstetrics,
Anders’ Practice, DaCosta’s Surgery, and the International Text-Book of
Surgery, edited by Warren and Gould. These books have made for
themselves a place among the best works on their several subjects.</p>

<h2>American Text-Book of Pathology</h2>

<p><b>American Text-Book of Pathology.</b> Edited by <span class="smcap">Ludvig Hektoen</span>, M. D.,
Professor of Pathology, Rush Medical College, in affiliation with the
University of Chicago; and <span class="smcap">David Riesman</span>, M. D., Professor of Clinical
Medicine, Philadelphia Polyclinic. Handsome imperial octavo, 1245 pages,

Morocco, $9.00 net.</p>

<h3>MOST SUMPTUOUSLY ILLUSTRATED PATHOLOGY IN ENGLISH</h3>

<p>The present work is the most representative treatise on the subject that
has appeared in English. It furnishes practitioners and students with a
comprehensive text-book on the essential principles and facts in General
Pathology and Pathologic Anatomy, with especial emphasis on the
relations of the latter to practical medicine. The illustrations are
nearly all original, and those in color are printed directly in the
text. In fact, the pictorial feature of the work forms a complete atlas
of pathologic anatomy and histology.</p>

<p class="nind"><b>Quarterly Medical Journal, Sheffield, England</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“As to the illustrations, we can only say that whilst all of them
are good, most of them are really beautiful, and for them alone the
book is worth having. Both colored and plain, they are distributed
so profusely as to add very largely to the interest of the reader
and to help the student.</p></div>

<h3>RECENTLY ISSUED</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Wells here presents the latest work systematically considering
the subject of general pathology from the standpoint of the
chemical processes involved. It is written for the physician, for
those engaged in research in pathology and physiologic chemistry,
and for the medical student. In the introductory chapter are
discussed the chemistry and physics of the animal cell, giving the
essential facts of ionization, diffusion, osmotic pressure, etc.,
and the relation of these facts to cellular activities. Special
chapters are devoted to <i>Diabetes</i> and to <i>Uric-acid Metabolism and
Gout</i>.</p></div>

manner, it is a companion work. The text gives the generally
accepted views in regard to the significance of pathologic
processes, explained in clear and easily understood language. The
lithographs in some cases required as many as twenty-six colors to
reproduce the original painting. Dr. Hektoen has made many
additions of great value.</p></div>

915 pages, 275 illustrations. Cloth, $4.00 net.</p>

<h3>RECENTLY ISSUED&mdash;NEW (2d) EDITION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Howell has had many years of experience as a teacher of
physiology in several of the leading medical schools, and is
therefore exceedingly well fitted to write a text-book on this
subject. Main emphasis has been laid upon those facts and views
which will be directly helpful in the practical branches of
medicine. At the same time, however, sufficient consideration has
been given to the experimental side of the science. The entire
literature of physiology has been thoroughly digested by Dr.
Howell, and the important views and conclusions introduced into his
work. Illustrations have been most freely used.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="nind">The Lancet, London</p>

<p>“This is one of the best recent text-books on physiology, and we
warmly commend it to the attention of students who desire to obtain
by reading a general, all-round, yet concise survey of the scope,
facts, theories, and speculations that make up its subject matter.”</p></div>

<h3>WITH 400 TEXT-CUTS, MANY IN COLORS, AND 7 COLORED PLATES</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this work the practical application of pathologic facts to
clinical medicine is considered more fully than is customary in
works on pathology. While the subject of pathology is treated in
the broadest way consistent with the size of the book, an effort
has been made to present the subject from the point of view of the
clinician. In the second part of the work the pathology of
individual organs and tissues is treated systematically and quite
fully under subheadings that clearly indicate the subject-matter to
be found on each page. In this edition the section dealing with
General Pathology has been most extensively revised, several of the
important chapters having been practically rewritten. A very useful
addition is an Appendix treating of the technic of pathologic
methods, giving briefly the most important methods at present in
use for the study of pathology, including, however, only those
methods capable of giving satisfactory results. The book will be
found to maintain fully its popularity.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>Gives a Maximum Amount of Matter in a Minimum Space, and at the Lowest

WITH 2000 NEW TERMS</h3>
<p>The immediate success of this work is due to the special features
that distinguish it from other books of its kind. It gives a
maximum of matter in a minimum space and at the lowest possible
cost. Though it is practically unabridged, yet by the use of thin
bible paper and flexible morocco binding it is only 1¾ inches
thick. The result is a truly luxurious specimen of book-making. In
this new edition the book has been thoroughly revised, and upward
of two thousand new terms that have appeared in recent medical
literature have been added, thus bringing the book absolutely up to
date. The book contains hundreds of terms not to be found in any
other dictionary, over 100 original tables, and many handsome
illustrations, a number in colors.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>WITH 212 ILLUSTRATIONS, 32 IN COLORS</h3>
<p>The fact of embryology having acquired in recent years such great
interest in connection with the teaching and with the proper
comprehension of human anatomy, it is of first importance to the
student of medicine that a concise and yet sufficiently full
text-book upon the subject be available. This new edition
represents all the latest advances recently made in the science of
embryology. Many portions have been entirely rewritten, and a great
deal of new and important matter added. A number of new
illustrations have also been introduced and these will prove very
valuable. The previous editions of this work filled a gap most
admirably, and this new edition will undoubtedly maintain the
reputation already won. Heisler’s Embryology has become a standard
work.</p></div>

<h3>WITH CHAPTERS ON POST-MORTEM TECHNIQUE AND AUTOPSIES</h3>

<p>In revising the book for the new edition the authors have kept in
view the needs of the laboratory worker, whether student,
practitioner, or pathologist, for a practical manual of histologic
and bacteriologic methods in the study of pathologic material. Many
parts have been rewritten, many new methods have been added, and
the number of illustrations has been considerably increased. Among
the many changes and additions may be mentioned the amplification
of the description of the Parasite of Actinomycosis and the
insertion of descriptions of the Bacillus of Bubonic Plague, of the
Parasite of Mycetoma, and Wright’s methods for the cultivation of
Anaërobic Bacteria. There have also been added new staining methods
for elastic tissue by Weigert, for bone by Schmorl, and for
connective tissue by Mallory. The new edition of this valuable work
keeps pace with the great advances made in pathology, and will
continue to be a most useful laboratory and post-mortem guide, full

<h3>RECENTLY ISSUED&mdash;NEW (2d) EDITION. ENLARGED</h3>

<p>The work of Drs. Böhm and Davidoff is well known in the German
edition, and has been considered one of the most practically useful
books on the subject of Human Histology. This second edition has
been in great part rewritten and very much enlarged by Dr. Huber,
who has also added over one hundred original illustrations. Dr.
Huber’s extensive additions have rendered the work the most
complete students’ text-book on Histology in existence.</p>

<p class="nind"><b>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</b></p>

<p>“Is unquestionably a text-book of the first rank, having been
carefully written by thorough masters of the subject, and in
certain directions it is much superior to any other histological
manual.”</p></div>

<p>This book gives a concise account of the technical procedures
necessary in the study of bacteriology, a brief description of the
life-history of the important pathogenic bacteria, and sufficient
description of the pathologic lesions accompanying the
micro-organismal invasions to give an idea of the origin of
symptoms and the causes of death. The illustrations are mainly
reproductions of the best the world affords, and are beautifully

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
